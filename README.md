<h1>C - Simple Shell</h1>
This is a Group Project by Kingsley Dade & Henry Asiedu
This is a completion of a milestone in the ALX Software engineering program

This is a UNIX Command Interpreter That does the following:

Executes Commands entered by the user
Implements the builtin command cd that changes the current directory of the process.
Implements the builtin command pwd that displays the current directory of the process.
Implements the builtin command ls that lists the files and directories in the current directory of the process.
The prompt should be able to function in both interactive and non-interactive mode
Handles Arguments in the other tasks
Exits from the shell
<h2>Compilation</h2>
The shell must be compiled with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

Run the code with ./hsh executable file
